<center><p>BALCH SPRINGS, Tex. - A police officer in a Dallas suburb was charged with murder on Friday, 
six days after he fired his rifle into a car full of teenagers leaving a party, killing a black 15-year-old in the front passenger seat.
The Dallas County Sheriff's Department issued a warrant on Friday for the arrest of the officer, Roy D. Oliver II, 37, the authorities said. 
Mr. Oliver turned himself in Friday night in Parker County, Tex., officials said.
Mr. Oliver, who was a patrol officer with the Balch Springs Police Department, responded late last Saturday to reports of underage drinking at a house party. 
Mr. Oliver and another officer entered the house but left after the police said they heard gunshots outside the residence.
As a car with five black teenagers inside drove away from the house, Mr. Oliver, who is white, fired his AR-15 rifle, fatally striking Jordan Edwards, 
a freshman at Mesquite High School, in the head, according to the police and the law firm representing the Edwards family.
The Balch Springs police chief fired Mr. Oliver on Tuesday, saying he had violated departmental policies. In the Police Department’s first account of the fatal shooting, 
Chief Jonathan Haber had said that the car was reversing aggressively toward the officers when Mr. 
Oliver opened fire. But after Chief Haber reviewed the two officers' body cameras, he corrected that description: 
The car had reversed but was accelerating forward and away from the officers when Jordan was struck. 
The Edwards family released a statement on Friday evening calling the arrest warrant "a bit of a reprieve in a time of intense mourning."
"Although we realize that there remain significant obstacles ahead on the road to justice, 
this action brings hope that the justice system will bend against the overwhelming weight of our frustration," the family said.
Cedric W. Davis Sr., a former mayor of Balch Springs, said the news of the murder charge would help ease tensions in the city, a working-class suburb of 25,000 east of Dallas.
"I think the benefit here is that it moved fast," said Mr. Davis, who became Balch Springs's first black mayor when he was elected in 2008. 
"The charge came quickly. In those previous cases, it took months and months," he said, referring to other high-profile shootings of young black men by police officers across the country.
The Edwards family urged people on Friday not to protest at Jordan's funeral. "Though we understand what his life and death mean symbolically, we are not ready to make a martyr of our son," the family said.
Linda Oliver, Mr. Oliver's mother, said Friday night, "We are under a hard no comment." She said that her son is being represented by James Lane, a Fort Worth lawyer, who did not return a call or an email.
The charges against Mr. Oliver came during another week of national debate about race and police brutality and amid uncertainty over how police violence will be addressed by the Trump administration. 
The Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated it will move away from the aggressive efforts of the Obama administration to oversee law enforcement agencies.</p></center>

<center><p>Kelly Thomas was a mentally ill and homeless man killed by police officers which sparked a nationwide outcry. His death came on July 10, five days after the 37-year-old was beaten by officers. 
In a video shown in court, he was seen laying on the ground being kicked and punched by the officers as he screamed for his father and help. In January last year, 
Manuel Ramos was found not guilty of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter and Jay Cicinelli was also acquitted of excessive force and involuntary manslaughter.</p></center>

<center><p>Michael Brown was an unarmed black teenager shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer on the street Ferguson, Missouri. Some said he had his hands up in the air and the shooting led to protests and some violence for 10 days. 
In November, a grand jury said the officer should not face criminal charges in the case that led to a nationwide discussion about the treatment of black people by white police officers.</p></center>

<center><p>Garner was killed after a New York police officer used a banned chokehold technique to restrain him, despite being unarmed. He was wrestled to the ground by several police officers after a complaint he was illegally selling loose cigarettes. 
In a video that went viral, the black 43-year-old said: "I can't breathe" which was soon adopted by protesters after Daniel Pantaleo, the only officer that was investigated by a grand jury, was not charged.</p></center>

<center><p>Twelve-year-old Rice was shot by Ohio police in a public park as he was playing with a BB gun. It was reported at the time that a man called police saying someone was brandishing a pistol but added it was "probably fake". 
The police claimed Rice reached into his waistband for the toy gun when the two officers ordered him to raise his hands. On Monday, Cleveland city claimed Rice's injuries - and subsequent death - 
“were directly and proximately caused by their own acts, not this defendant” in response to the family's lawsuit. In the lawsuit, 
the family accuses officers Frank Frank Garmback and Timothy Loehmann of acting recklessly and failing to provide first aid and also name the city of Cleveland as a defendant</p></center>
