<center><p>BALCH SPRINGS, Tex. - A police officer in a Dallas suburb was charged with murder on Friday, 
six days after he fired his rifle into a car full of teenagers leaving a party, killing a black 15-year-old in the front passenger seat.
The Dallas County Sheriff's Department issued a warrant on Friday for the arrest of the officer, Roy D. Oliver II, 37, the authorities said. 
Mr. Oliver turned himself in Friday night in Parker County, Tex., officials said.
Mr. Oliver, who was a patrol officer with the Balch Springs Police Department, responded late last Saturday to reports of underage drinking at a house party. 
Mr. Oliver and another officer entered the house but left after the police said they heard gunshots outside the residence.
As a car with five black teenagers inside drove away from the house, Mr. Oliver, who is white, fired his AR-15 rifle, fatally striking Jordan Edwards, 
a freshman at Mesquite High School, in the head, according to the police and the law firm representing the Edwards family.
The Balch Springs police chief fired Mr. Oliver on Tuesday, saying he had violated departmental policies. In the Police Departmentâ€™s first account of the fatal shooting, 
Chief Jonathan Haber had said that the car was reversing aggressively toward the officers when Mr. 
Oliver opened fire. But after Chief Haber reviewed the two officers' body cameras, he corrected that description: 
The car had reversed but was accelerating forward and away from the officers when Jordan was struck. 
The Edwards family released a statement on Friday evening calling the arrest warrant "a bit of a reprieve in a time of intense mourning."
"Although we realize that there remain significant obstacles ahead on the road to justice, 
this action brings hope that the justice system will bend against the overwhelming weight of our frustration," the family said.
Cedric W. Davis Sr., a former mayor of Balch Springs, said the news of the murder charge would help ease tensions in the city, a working-class suburb of 25,000 east of Dallas.
"I think the benefit here is that it moved fast," said Mr. Davis, who became Balch Springs's first black mayor when he was elected in 2008. 
"The charge came quickly. In those previous cases, it took months and months," he said, referring to other high-profile shootings of young black men by police officers across the country.
The Edwards family urged people on Friday not to protest at Jordan's funeral. "Though we understand what his life and death mean symbolically, we are not ready to make a martyr of our son," the family said.
Linda Oliver, Mr. Oliver's mother, said Friday night, "We are under a hard no comment." She said that her son is being represented by James Lane, a Fort Worth lawyer, who did not return a call or an email.
The charges against Mr. Oliver came during another week of national debate about race and police brutality and amid uncertainty over how police violence will be addressed by the Trump administration. 
The Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated it will move away from the aggressive efforts of the Obama administration to oversee law enforcement agencies.</p>
